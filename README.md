- **User Registration**: Add details such as username, email, phone number, and notes.  
  *(Password field exists but is currently unused and may be removed)*  
- **User Management**: View, update, delete, reorder users, and add notes.
- **AWS S3 Integration**: Automatically saves and loads the user list to and from an S3 bucket.
- **Web Interface**: Responsive CSS/Bootstrap-based UI.

## üõ† AWS Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Configure EC2 Security Group

When creating the EC2 instance or afterward:

- **Allow HTTP Access (Port 80)**  
  For running a web server like Nginx alongside Flask:
  - Type: HTTP  
  - Protocol: TCP  
  - Port Range: 80  
  - Source: `0.0.0.0/0` *(or restrict to specific IPs for security)*

- **Allow Flask (Port 5000)**  
  For direct Flask access:
  - Type: Custom TCP Rule  
  - Protocol: TCP  
  - Port Range: 5000  
  - Source: `0.0.0.0/0` *(or restrict to specific IPs)*

**To add these rules:**
1. Go to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to **EC2 ‚Üí Instances ‚Üí Security Groups**.
3. Select the security group attached to your EC2 instance.
4. Under **Inbound Rules**, click **Edit** and add the necessary rules.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create IAM Role with S3 Access

To allow your Flask application to interact with S3:

1. Go to the **AWS Management Console**.
2. Navigate to **IAM ‚Üí Roles**.
3. Click **Create Role** and follow these steps:
   - **Trusted Entity Type:** AWS service
   - **Use Case:** EC2
4. Click **Next** to attach a policy:
   - Search for **AmazonS3FullAccess** *(or a custom policy with limited S3 permissions)*.
   - Attach the policy.
5. Complete the role creation process.

> **Note:** S3 creation in the web app is currently supported for **Region 1 only**.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Attach IAM Role to the EC2 Instance

1. Navigate to **EC2 ‚Üí Instances** in the AWS Management Console.
2. Select your EC2 instance.
3. Click **Actions ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Modify IAM Role**.
4. Attach the IAM role you created.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance Notes

t2.micro instance barely runs this program and often locks up within a few minutes.
Recommended: at least t2.medium (2 CPU, 4GB RAM) with a 20GB volume.
Use the Ubuntu AMI for your instance.


---

## üöÄ Running via Docker on EC2

1. **Connect to your EC2 instance**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update -y
   sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
   sudo systemctl enable --now docker

    Pull the Docker image (v3 is latest)

sudo docker pull gman9500/s3-user-vault:v3

Run the container (example)

sudo docker run -p 5000:5000 gman9500/s3-user-vault:v3

Access the app

    Get your EC2 Public IPv4 DNS from the AWS Console. Example:

ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.compute-1.amazonaws.com

Add :5000/register to the end:

And then in your browser address field:  ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5000/register
